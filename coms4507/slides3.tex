\section{Solidity: Ethereum's Smart Contract Language}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Statically-typed programming language
	\item Compiles to bytecode which is run on the EVM
	\item Every operation (OP\_CODE) in the bytecode costs gas, this makes sure that smart contracts cannot run forever on the Turing Complete EVM
	\item A smart contract, in the case of Solidity, is a collection of code (the functions of the smart contract) and data (the state of the smart contract), which resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain
\end{itemize}
