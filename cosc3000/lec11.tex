\section{Computer Graphics (CG)}
\subsection{What is CG}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Algorithms, Techniques, and Processes that
	\item Execute on computers (by definition)
	\item Produce images (of some description)
	\subitem On screens, in files, VR headsets, printers, t-shirts, or anything really
	\item Related (sometimes very closely) but \textit{not} CG as such
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Image processing
		\item Data acquisition / scanning
		\item Fabrication (e.g. 3d printing)
		\item Simulation
		\item Visualisation
	\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Offline}
Higher quality image or series of images. Can take hours to compute which is fine because there is no human interaction.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Frame time > 2 min
	\item Final image quality (render farms)
	\item Image stability (animation)
	\item Time to predictive image	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interactive}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 33ms - 1s/frame
	\item Performance (Special HW ok)	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Real Time}
Main goal is to be interactive, so quality is a secondary concern.
\begin{itemize}
	\item <33ms / frame
	\item Single workstation performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{VR / AR}
\begin{itemize}
	\item <10ms / frame
	\item Single workstation performance
	\item Stereo images
	\item Wide field of view
	\item Low latency
	\item Disparity
	\item Image stability
	\item Close range detail	
\end{itemize}
