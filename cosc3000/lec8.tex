\section{Multivariate data analysis}
Lets us reduce the number of dimensions (variables) we need to describe the data

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}
\begin{leftbar}
PCA aims to let us describe most of the variation in our data with a small number of independent variables	
\end{leftbar}

\subsection{Cluster Analysis}
\begin{leftbar}
Cluster analysis aims to classify the data into discrete groups. Then, we can describe a data point simply by specifying which group it belongs to	
\end{leftbar}
