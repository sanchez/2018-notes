\section{CPU Control Unit}
\subsection{Control Unit}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Control signals come from the \textbf{control unit}
	\item Control unit must generate the control signals in the right order for a given instruction
	\subitem Instruction determined by contents of the \textbf{Instruction Register (IR)}	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Influencing Control}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Need to know more than what's in the instruction register
	\item Control unit can't operate without knowing something about the data
	\item \textbf{Status Register}
	\subitem Determined by ALU operations
	\subitem Stores status of last ALU operation	
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}{Status Register}
Typically Includes:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Z:] zero bit -- was the last result 0?
		\item[V:] overflow bit -- did the last addition/subtraction operation overflow (assuming it was a two's complement operation)?
		\item[C:] carry bit -- was a carry out generated?
		\item[N:] negative bit -- was the result negative if considered as two's complement (i.e. what's the sign bit)?
	\end{description}
