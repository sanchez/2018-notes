\begin{note}{AVR Status Bit}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $N$ bit $=$ negative (1 if sign bit of result is 1)
		\item $V$ bit $=$ two's complement overflow
		\item $S=N\oplus V$	
	\end{itemize}
	If overflow happens, sign bit will be wrong so instead of checking $N$ bit, check $S$ bit
\end{note}

\section{Flow of Control}
\subsection{Procedures}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Group of instructions that performs some task
	\item May have operands (\textbf{arguments} or \textbf{parameters})
	\item May produce result(s)
	\item Can be \textbf{invoked} (called) from multiple places in program
	\item After invocation, control returns to the statement after the call
	\item Also known as a \textbf{subroutine, function, method}	
	\item Return address is stored in a stack
\end{itemize}
