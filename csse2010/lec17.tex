\section{Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)}
\begin{description}
	\item[Duty cycle:] \% of time that the signal is high
	\item[Average Value:] If the periodic pulse is fast enough, signal looks like the average value (brightness control of led)
	\item[Fast PWM Mode:] Output is high on \texttt{OCR0B} trigger and low (and reset) on \texttt{OCR0A} trigger
	\item[Phase Correct PWM:] Center of pulses remain the same point in period. Counter counts up and then down
