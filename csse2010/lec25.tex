\section{Pipelining}
Allows the processor to fetch and execute code ahead of time
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{Higher clock rate} (i.e. reduced clock cycle time)
	\subitem Maximum clock rate determined by most complex logic path in circuit
	\item\textbf{Higher throughput} more instructions executed per unit time
	\subitem Achieve one instruction per cycle (if pipeline is full)	
\end{itemize}
