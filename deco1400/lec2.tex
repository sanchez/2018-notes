\section{Stakeholders}
Customers == users! There are other users too:

	\subitem Customer service, sales, etc
	\item External stakeholders
	\subitem Suppliers, couriers, etc	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Centred Design (UCD)}
\begin{leftbar}
	``Users just aren't that into you. It's not personal. It's business. Unles what you're writing...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item solves their problem
		\item provides useful information
		\item entertains them
		\item makes them feel like they rule	
	\end{itemize}
	... it's irrational to expect users to care about it.''
\end{leftbar}
From Users Don't Care About You by Jeff Atwood
