\section{Aesthetics}

	\item The sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object or phenomenon

	\item Our perception of the `pleasure' of an object/phenomenon	
\end{itemize}


\section{Responsive Design}
\subsection{Mobile-First Approach}
Makes you think about layout, navigation and content
\begin{itemize}
	\item What's the minimum to be included?	
\end{itemize}
Define all styles for mobile size and above
\begin{itemize}
	\item Then, override styles for tablet/desktop sizes	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Desktop-first Approach}
Opposite to mobile-first approach
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define tablet/desktop size styles, then override styles for mobile
	\item Produces a less than optimal result for mobile (e.g. too much content, too complex a layout etc)	
\end{itemize}
